Falling Mud makes mud fall exactly like sand! You might be thinking, "damn  the jungle is gonna be screwed". THe jungle grass keeps the jungle perfectly fine.

Thanks so much to blushie's old code that allowed me to make a falling block. From there, I modifed the block to work with mud, not its own block and fixed some errors along the way
